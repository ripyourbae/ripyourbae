- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My Name is Arif Hidayat
- ðŸ“« How to reach me with email uchmod@gmail.com

Since 2014 I have been working as a freelance web developer. I mostly work on the Backend Web Developer, using PHP as the main programming language. I usually use Laravel, WordPress, or Codeigniter in my work processes.

I am currently working as a COO at one of the Start Ups in Purwokerto, namely Tilikgram Purwokerto which is engaged in Phone Repair Services, Web Application Development and Technology Development at MSMEs. I work with various types of agencies to build various needs that use the website as a solution platform.

I am grateful to have the opportunity to contribute to various projects and startups from several regions in Central Java.
